In Pybank, I was tasked with analyzing basic financial records for a company. This python script is now able to find:
The total number of months included in any dataset. 
The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
And finally, this script is able to export the analysis as a txt file to any folder on your computer and print it to a terminal.
