In Pypoll, I was given election data for  a town of over 3 million people and I wrote a python script that  analyzed the votes and calculated each of the following:
The total number of votes cast.
A complete list of candidates who received votes.
The percentage of votes each candidate won.
The total number of votes each candidate won.
The winner of the election based on popular vote.
And finally, this script is able to export the analysis as a txt file to any folder on your computer and print it to a terminal.
